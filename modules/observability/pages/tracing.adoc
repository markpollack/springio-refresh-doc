= Distributed Tracing

== Problem

In a microservices architecture a single request from the user results in multiple requests to several microservices.

If there are reported problems from the user relating to performance, how can you go about troubleshooting the system to detect bottlenecks.

== Solution

Each microservice application should be instrumented so that it can record timing and other debug information into the application's log file.

A unique id per user request is recorded in the log so that multiple log files can be corrolated to show the full path of processing through multiple microservices.
This type of logging data is referred to as tracing data.

https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-sleuth[Spring Cloud Seuth] is the project that you can use in your solution to solve this type of problem.
Spring Cloud Seuth also integrates with https://zipkin.io/[Zipkin].  Zipkin collects the trace data and presents a dashboard used to visualize the data you use for troubleshooting.

== Example Architectures

In the following architecture, a user makes a request to the website `http://billing.my.com`.  The request is first recieved by the microservice `#0` which in turn makes a request to microservice `#1` and microservice `#2`.  In turn, they make other request to other microservices and databases.

The red color of microservice `#1` indicates that it is the microservice that is the source of the bottleneck in request processing.

== Gist 

By adding Spring Cloud Sleuth library dependencies to your microservice application, you can automatically get trace data for common ingress and egress points from a Spring application.

For example, incoming and outgoing web requests and incoming and outgoing requests for message brokers such as Kafka, JMS, and RabbitMQ.

You do not need to write any code in your applicaiton to get going.

Assuming you have already added Spring Cloud Sleuth dependencies, a simple spring application shown below is all you need to get trace data added to your log file.

[source,java]
----
@RestController
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class Example {

    private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Example.class);

    @RequestMapping("/")
    String home() {
        log.info("Hello world!");
        return "Hello World!";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Example.class, args);
    }

}
----

In the logging output you will see a line such as


```
2020-10-21 12:01:16.285  INFO [backend,0b6aaf642574edd3,0b6aaf642574edd3] 289589 --- [nio-9000-exec-1] Example              : Hello world!
```

The logging format has been updated to include trace data.  

The trace data has three parts

* application name, 
* trace id
* the span id.

The details of what trace id and span id can be found in the https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-sleuth/docs/3.1.1/reference/htmlsingle/spring-cloud-sleuth.html#getting-started-terminology[reference documentation]

By adding and additional dependency to each Spring microservice the trace data can be sent to a Zipkin server for visualization.

In the diagram below you can see the total time spent for a single request and how long that single request spent in each microservice instance.
