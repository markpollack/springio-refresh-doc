= Scheduling

== Problem

You would like to execute some processing task based on a schedule.
The task can be as simple as logging information every hour to a log file or transferring files from Amazon S3 to a local computer for processing at a specific time.

== Solution

The Spring Framework provides several annotations to simplify the use of the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/executors.html[Java's Executor Framework] for task scheduling and asynchronous method invocation.
The Executor Framework manages the resources required to execute a task.
The managed resources are threads, allowing processing tasks to execute in a thread pool separate from the rest of the application.

== Example Architecture

The Java Executor framework is responsible for scheduling the execution of a task, which we can think of as the logic contained in the method of a Java class.
Tasks are submitted to a queue and then pulled off the queue and executed on a dedicated thread pool.
Instead of working with the low-level JDK classes, you can implement this type of architecture using a few Spring annotations on your Java classes.

== Gist

To setup the underlying scheduling infrastructure, add the `@EnableScheduling` annotation to your main Spring Boot application class.

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableScheduling
public class SchedulingTasksApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(SchedulingTasksApplication.class);
	}
}
----

The processing that we will schedule to execute is in a class method.
The method should have a void return type and have any parameters.
In a complete example, you would use dependency injection to access collaborating objects configured for the processing task.

In this simple gist, the processing will write to `System.out`.

[source,java]
----
public class MyTask {

  @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 * * * *")
  public void task() {
      System.out.println("task() method executed at the top of every hour every day.")
  }

}
----

By default the size of the thread pool is set to one.
You can change that by setting the following property in `application.properties`

```
spring.task.scheduling.pool.size=10
```

Other options on the `@Scheduled` annotation support the execution of the method at a fixed interval of time.
