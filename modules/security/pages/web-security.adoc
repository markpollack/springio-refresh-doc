= Web Security

== Problem

You want to add authentication, authorization, and protection against common exploits to your web application.


== Solution

=== Authentication
Spring Security provides built-in support for authentication.
Authentication is how we verify the identity of who is trying to access a particular resource.
A common way to authenticate users is by requiring the user to enter a username and password.
Once authentication is performed, we know the identity and can complete authorization.

=== Authorization
Spring Security provides comprehensive and extensible support for authorization.
While authentication is how we verify who is trying to access a particular resource, authorization verifies whether that user can access that resource.
This term is often used interchangeably with access control.

=== Protection against common exploits
Adding Spring Security to your application will allow you to easily protect against exploits such as session fixation, clickjacking, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), etc.

== Example Architectures

=== Securing an endpoint with HTTP Basic

In the following diagram, the application requires a user to authenticate via HTTP Basic to access the home page.
When a client (such as a web browser) makes a request to the server without sending any credentials, the server responds with a `401 Unauthorized` response status.
It also sets the `WWW-Authenticate` response header, which causes the browser to prompt the user for credentials.
The browser then makes a request to `/home` again with the credentials in the `Authorization` header.
Depending on whether the credentials are valid or not, the server responds with a `200 OK` status or `401 Unauthorized` status.

The above architecture does not enforce any authorization and assumes that all authenticated users can access `/home`.
However, it is typical for an application to have multiple users with different permissions and allow access to a resource based on who has logged in.

== Gist

Adding Spring Security dependencies to your Spring Boot application provides a set of secure defaults for your application.
For example, when adding the `spring-boot-starter-security` dependency, all web endpoints will be secure by default and require an authentic user to access them.
Spring Boot also configures a default user with a generated password.
You do not need to write any code in your application to get the default setup.

If you want to customize Spring Boot's defaults, such as allow only admin users to access certain pages, you can do so easily:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
public class SecurityConfiguration {

    @Bean
	SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
		http.authorizeRequests((requests) -> {
			requests.antMatchers("/admin").hasRole("ROLE_ADMIN");
			requests.anyRequest().authenticated();
		});
		http.httpBasic(Customizer.withDefaults());
		return http.build();
	}
}
----

HTTP Basic is just one of the authentication mechanisms that Spring Security supports.
Others including OAuth 2.0 Login, SAML 2.0 Login, Form login are also supported.
